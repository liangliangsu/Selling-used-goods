# Selling-used-goods Project

## Summary
This project is an extended project of a previous competition hosted in kaggle.com (Avito Demand Prediction Challenge). In this project, I will scrap data from popular used item selling websites to establish database. Prediction models will be trained to predict the deal probability at seller side. Also prediction models will be trained to predict the estimated values based on features of used items. At final stage, I will make a web application that can automaticlly target great deals based on previous trained models.

## Goals
1. Establish database by scrapping data from popular used item selling websites. (Progressing)
2. Train models to predict the deal probability at seller side. (Half completed)
3. Train models to predict the estimated values of used goods at buyer side. (Planned)
4. Search engine that can automaticlly target great deals. (Planned)

## Data source
1. The majarity of the dataset used in the deal probability prediction model is from kaggle.com
https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction/data
2. The rest part of data is scraped from Craigslist. This scraped data is only a tiny part of the actually used dataset.

## This repo contain notebooks and a plot of model architecture. 
1. The visualization analysis is displayed in Visualisations.ipynb
2. The model architecture is displayed in model_architecture.png
3. Other notebooks are source codes.
